                <p>From dishwashing to fueling planes, I’ve worked across a broad field of varying industries, and gathered a comprehensive and unique set of viewpoints and experiences from them. Now with Software Engineering I’ve found a profession and skill set that I know I can bring all those previous experiences to bear on, as I settle into a lifetime of sharpening my coding and software development skills. My work and curiosity is driven by my passion for developing a craft. And this commitment can be shown through each challenge I solve, approaching it as a chance to dig into a new concept or ideal! I am self motivated and can deliver work independently, but I also enjoy lending my expertise to, and collaborating with a team of my peers. I bring a positive attitude and rigorous work ethic to both.</p>
